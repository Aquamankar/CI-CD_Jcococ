SonarQube + JaCoCo Guide
1. SonarQube Basics
• What is SonarQube and why it’s used (code quality, technical debt, CI/CD integration).
• SonarLint (IDE plugin) vs SonarQube (server).
• Key Concepts: Rules, Quality Profiles, Quality Gates, Measures & Metrics.


2. SonarQube Setup & Configuration
• Installing & running SonarQube (local with Docker or zip).
• SonarQube server vs database.
• SonarScanner and sonar-project.properties.
• Authentication tokens (instead of passwords).


3. SonarQube with Build Tools
• Maven integration (mvn sonar:sonar).
• Gradle integration (./gradlew sonarqube).
• npm/JavaScript projects integration.


4. SonarQube in CI/CD
• Jenkins pipeline integration.
• GitHub Actions / GitLab CI / Azure DevOps integration.
• SonarCloud vs self-hosted SonarQube.


5. Advanced SonarQube Features
• Custom Quality Profiles (enable/disable specific rules).
• Quality Gates (enforce rules in CI/CD).
• Coverage reports (JaCoCo for Java, Istanbul for JS).
• Security Hotspots (OWASP, SAST).
• Pull Request decoration.


6. JaCoCo Basics
• What is code coverage and why it matters.
• Types of coverage: Line, Branch, Instruction, Method, Class.
7. JaCoCo Setup & Integration
• Maven configuration for JaCoCo.
• Gradle configuration for JaCoCo.
• Generating HTML, XML, CSV reports.


8. Using JaCoCo with SonarQube
• Run tests with JaCoCo to generate XML report.
• Configure SonarQube to read XML report.
• Example sonar-project.properties setup.


9. Advanced JaCoCo Usage
• Exclude classes/packages (DTOs, Config).
• Use in CI/CD pipelines (GitHub Actions, Jenkins, GitLab).
• Set minimum coverage rules in SonarQube Quality Gate.
